## Accumulated Context

### Key Decisions
- Focus on database schema and API validation/implementation (not frontend or QA)
- Someone else is working on QA, frontend, and backend integration
- All spec information is in first.md

### Technical Notes
- SQLAlchemy models already defined in backend/app/models.py
- Pydantic schemas defined in backend/app/schemas.py
- Migration file 001_baseline.sql is a stub (needs full SQL)
- API routers exist but some may be incomplete
- Docker Compose already configured with PostgreSQL 16 and Redis 7
